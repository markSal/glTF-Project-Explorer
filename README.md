repository, add your project information to the
[`glTF-projects-data.json`](public/data/glTF-projects-data.json) file,
and submit a pull request with the changes. Alternatively, you can

| `type`                | `string[]`               | An array of strings characterizing the type of the project. <br> <br> Common types are `application`, `library`, `plugin`, `demo`, `web-api`, or `engine`. The types can be combined, for example, when a library can also be used as a standalone command-line application. <br> <br> Other types of projects may be `forum` or `website`, or `model-repository`.                                                                                                                                             |

| `language`            | `string[]`               | An array of strings indicating the programming languages of the project, where applicable. <br> <br> Examples of languages are `JavaScript`, `C++`, `Java`, or `TypeScript`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `inputs`<br>`outputs` | `string[]`<br>`string[]` | Arrays of strings listing the supported file types. These fields should at least contain the string `glTF 1.0` or `glTF 2.0`, indicating which glTF version is supported.<br> <br> Further file types may be listed for viewers or converters, to indicate the supported input- and output types. This is usually done by listing the file extension - for example, `OBJ`, `FBX`, or `COLLADA`. For universal viewers or converters, the string `Multiple` can be used instead of listing all file extensions. |

All properties except for the `name` are optional.

An example of the JSON description of a project is shown here:

```json
{
  "name": "Example",
  "link": "http://example.com",
  "description": "An example project. The description can contain basic markdown.",
  "task": ["view", "import", "export"],
  "type": ["application", "library"],
  "license": ["MIT", "CC-BY-2.5"],
  "language": ["TypeScript"],
  "inputs": ["glTF 1.0", "glTF 2.0", "OBJ"],
  "outputs": ["glTF 2.0", "FBX"]
}
```

## Developing

The glTF Project Explorer tool uses Create React App to simplify maintenance.
Please look at [DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md) for information on how Create
React App works.
