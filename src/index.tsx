// A note about the use of redux here; a lot of inner deliberations were made
// before choosing to pull in both Redux and Sagas for this app. The idea is
// to keep this app mostly simple, but Redux and Sagas were pulled in for two
// major reasons:
//
//   1. We have to communicate data changes across the app to several components.
//   2. Redux makes managing complex state changes (such as filtering) easy.
//
// Yes, this is probably over-engineered, but Redux is the best tool for this
// potentially complex task. If you hate it, blame me and I'd be glad to bike
// shed about it with you. -ANM
